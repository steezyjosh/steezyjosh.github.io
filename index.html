    <h2>The Why</h2>
    <!--Use grammarly to edit paragraph-->
      <p>When I first heard about coding, I just thought about the many hours sitting behind a computer. <br> That must be awful and quite annoying.When I first tried it out, I was a bit intrested, but I gave up on it. <br> Fast foward to 2020 and now we are in a pandemic. <br> Being bored, as anyone would be, I decided to pick up coding again. <br> And wow did I like it. As of now, I am learning HTML and I plan to learn CSS. </p>
    <h4>Reasons for starting</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A new skill</li>
          <li>Benefical for business</li>
          <li>Possible free lance opportunity</li>
          <li>Why not? I'm bored</li>
        </ul>

  <h1>What do I plan to use with code?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>As the world starts to change and technology grows, I believe it is important to learn how to code. <br>If I learn how to code, there may be opportunites, such as freelancing, <br>which would not have been open to me had I not learned code.
