  <h2>The Why</h2>
    <!--Use grammarly to edit paragraph-->
    <p>When I first heard about coding, I just thought about the many hours sitting behind a computer. <break> That must be awful and quite annoying.When I first tried it out, I was a bit intrested, but I gave up on it. <break> Fast foward to 2020 and now we are in a pandemic. <break> Being bored, as anyone would be, I decided to pick up coding again. <break> And wow did I like it. As of now, I am learning HTML and I plan to learn CSS. </p>
